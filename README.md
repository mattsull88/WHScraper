# WHScraper
This was made to run hourly to send a teleram message when new products are added to stock or old items come into stock. Stock items and history are kept in s SQLite database and I pushed the database file to a web server so I could clearly see what was in stock
This was originally adapted from a more simple sneaker stock alerter. I was not looking to add in automated purchasing in any way, purely for alerting
